# SOC2 Type II Compliance Framework for Plinto

This directory contains the comprehensive SOC2 Type II compliance framework for the Plinto authentication platform, designed to meet enterprise audit requirements and demonstrate control effectiveness over time.

## Framework Overview

The SOC2 Type II framework addresses the five Trust Services Criteria with measurable controls, evidence collection, and continuous monitoring.

### Trust Services Criteria Covered
- **Security** (Common Criteria) - Baseline security controls for all audits
- **Availability** - System availability and operational performance
- **Processing Integrity** - Data processing accuracy and completeness
- **Confidentiality** - Protection of confidential information
- **Privacy** - Personal information collection, use, retention, and disposal
