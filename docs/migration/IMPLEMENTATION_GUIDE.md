# 🚀 Implementation Guide: Path to Production

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What We Have (85% Complete)
- **Python FastAPI** production-ready with comprehensive features
- **Database migrations** with enterprise schema
- **New MVP services** designed and ready for Python implementation
- **Clear migration strategy** preserving all work

### 🔄 What Needs Migration (2 weeks)
| Component | Source | Target | Priority | Effort |
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|--------|
| OrganizationMemberService | TypeScript | Python | HIGH | 4h |
| RBACService | TypeScript | Python | HIGH | 3h |
| WebhookRetryService | TypeScript | Python | MEDIUM | 3h |
| AuditLogService | TypeScript | Python | MEDIUM | 2h |
| SessionRotationService | TypeScript | Python (enhance existing) | LOW | 2h |

## Immediate Actions (Today)

### Step 1: Run Migration Script
```bash
# Execute the automated migration
./scripts/migrate-to-production.sh

# This will:
# - Create Python service implementations
# - Run database migrations
# - Archive TypeScript API
# - Update project configuration
```

### Step 2: Verify Services
```bash
# Test Python API
cd apps/api
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Check service implementations
ls app/services/*.py
```

### Step 3: Integration Testing
```bash
# Start the API
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# Test endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health
```

## Week 1 Tasks

### Monday-Tuesday: Core Services
- [ ] Complete OrganizationMemberService testing
- [ ] Verify RBAC integration with existing auth
- [ ] Test webhook retry mechanism

### Wednesday-Thursday: Integration
- [ ] Connect services to API routes
- [ ] Update middleware for RBAC
- [ ] Integrate audit logging

### Friday: Validation
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Performance benchmarking
- [ ] Security audit

## Week 2 Tasks

### Monday-Tuesday: Production Prep
- [ ] Configure monitoring (APM, logs, metrics)
- [ ] Set up Redis cluster
- [ ] Database optimization

### Wednesday-Thursday: Deployment
- [ ] Update CI/CD pipelines
- [ ] Deploy to staging
- [ ] Load testing

### Friday: Go-Live
- [ ] Production deployment
- [ ] Monitor metrics
- [ ] Document lessons learned

## Quick Wins (Can Do Now)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd apps/api
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install httpx  # For webhook service
```

### 2. Run Database Migration
```bash
cd apps/api
alembic upgrade head
```

### 3. Start Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Redis
redis-server

# Terminal 2: Start PostgreSQL
docker-compose up -d postgres

# Terminal 3: Start API
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Configuration Checklist

### Environment Variables
```env
# apps/api/.env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/plinto
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
ENVIRONMENT=development
```

### Database Indexes (Already in migration)
- ✅ Organization tenant_id
- ✅ Audit logs timestamp
- ✅ Session families
- ✅ RBAC policies

### Redis Keys Structure
```
org_members:{org_id}
member_perms:{user_id}:{org_id}
invitation:{token}
webhook:retry:queue
webhook:dlq
audit:stream:{org_id}
rbac:{user_id}:{org_id}:{permission}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
```python
# apps/api/tests/services/test_organization_member.py
def test_add_member():
    # Test member addition

def test_invitation_flow():
    # Test invitation lifecycle
```

### Integration Tests
```python
# apps/api/tests/integration/test_rbac.py
def test_permission_enforcement():
    # Test RBAC in API routes

def test_audit_logging():
    # Verify audit trail
```

### Load Tests
```bash
# Use locust for load testing
locust -f tests/load/locustfile.py --host=http://localhost:8000
```

## Monitoring Setup

### Key Metrics to Track
- **API Performance**: p50, p95, p99 latency
- **Error Rates**: 4xx, 5xx responses
- **Business Metrics**: Active orgs, user sessions, webhook success rate
- **Infrastructure**: CPU, memory, Redis connections, DB pool

### Recommended Stack
```yaml
monitoring:
  apm: New Relic or Datadog
  logs: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
  errors: Sentry
  metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
  uptime: StatusPage or Better Uptime
```

## Production Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Completed
- [x] Database schema with migrations
- [x] Authentication & authorization
- [x] Session management
- [x] API structure
- [x] Docker configuration
- [x] Service architecture

### 📋 In Progress (This Week)
- [ ] Service migrations to Python
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Security hardening

### 🔜 Next Week
