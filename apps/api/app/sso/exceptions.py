SSO Module Exceptions

DEPRECATED: This module is maintained for backward compatibility only.
New code should import from app.core.exceptions instead.

All SSO exceptions now inherit from the unified exception system in app.core.exceptions.
This provides HTTP status codes and consistent error handling across the application.
